# SOLINUM POI

This is the front end and back end server for a MERN Project... !

### Back end Prerequisites

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation

Clone this repo. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. You
can then run the server with `node server`.
you must use mongodb atlas and run 'npm i mongoose' , run 'npm node-fetch' and run 'npm i validator'
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `8080`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 8081`.

The front should run on `localhost` with default port `8081`
